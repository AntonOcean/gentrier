/Users/a.tsitulskii/AndroidStudioProjects/gentrier/data/src/main/java/com/example/gentrier/data/service/LocationTrackingService.kt:146: Error: Missing permissions required by FusedLocationProviderClient.requestLocationUpdates: android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION [MissingPermission]
            fusedLocationClient.requestLocationUpdates(
            ^

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingPermission":
   This check scans through your code and libraries and looks at the APIs
   being used, and checks this against the set of permissions required to
   access those APIs. If the code using those APIs is called at runtime, then
   the program will crash.

   Furthermore, for permissions that are revocable (with targetSdkVersion 23),
   client code must also be prepared to handle the calls throwing an exception
   if the user rejects the request for permission at runtime.

   Explanation for issues of type "NewApi":
   This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and
   warns about any calls that are not available on all versions targeted by
   this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).

   If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices
   just set the minSdkVersion in your build.gradle or AndroidManifest.xml
   files.

   If your code is deliberately accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured
   (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called
   on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with
   the @TargetApi annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such
   as @TargetApi(11), such that this check considers 11 rather than your
   manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.

   If you are deliberately setting android: attributes in style definitions,
   make sure you place this in a values-vNN folder in order to avoid running
   into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added
   custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

   Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi="11" in an XML file to indicate that
   the element will only be inflated in an adequate context.

/Users/a.tsitulskii/AndroidStudioProjects/gentrier/data/build.gradle.kts:54: Warning: A newer version of com.google.android.gms:play-services-location than 21.0.1 is available: 21.3.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:21.0.1")
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

    kapt(libs.androidx.room.compiler)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "KaptUsageInsteadOfKsp":
   KSP is a more efficient replacement for kapt. For libraries that support
   both, KSP should be used to improve build times.

    implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:21.0.1")
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseTomlInstead":
   If your project is using a libs.versions.toml file, you should place all
   Gradle dependencies in the TOML file. This lint check looks for version
   declarations outside of the TOML file and suggests moving them (and in the
   IDE, provides a quickfix to performing the operation automatically).
